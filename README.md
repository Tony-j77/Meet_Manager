# Meet_Manager

Google Meet© extension that was developed for use within the Calgary Board of Education. The extension limited "zoom-bombing" (where students would join the video call to disrupt the class) by only admiting preapproved students. The extension also kept track of when students entered the Meet as well as their exit time to streamline the attendance process for the teacher. 

## Features
 1. Pre-approved attendance list
 2. Automatically kick unwarranted participants
 3. Show join and leave time of participants
 4. Auto-export attendance data to Google Sheets© after the end of each session
