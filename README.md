# Meet_Manager

Google MeetÂ© extension that was developed for use within the Calgary Board of Education. The extension limited "zoom-bombing" (where students would join the video call to disrupt the class) by only admiting preapproved students. The extension also kept track of when students entered the Meet as well as their exit time to streamline the attendance process for the teacher.
